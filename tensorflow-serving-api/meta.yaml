  summary: TensorFlow Serving is an open-source library for serving machine learning models
  description: |
    TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models,
    designed for production environments. TensorFlow Serving makes it easy to deploy new algorithms
    and experiments, while keeping the same server architecture and APIs. TensorFlow Serving provides
    out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models, but can be easily extended to serve other
    types of models and data.
